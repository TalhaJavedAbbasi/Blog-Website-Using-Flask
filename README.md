# My Flask Blog Website

Welcome to my Flask blog website! This is a simple yet functional blog where users can read posts, learn more about the author, and get in touch via a contact form. The blog is built using Python and Flask, with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Lists all blog posts with their titles, snippets, and links to the full post.
- **Individual Blog Posts:** Each post has its own dedicated page, accessible via a unique URL.
- **About Page:** Provides information about the author or the purpose of the blog.
- **Contact Page:** Includes a form where users can submit their name, email, phone number, and a message. The form data is processed and logged on the server.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
